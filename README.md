# CLTV_Computation
Customer Life Time Value (CLTV) is the net present value (NPV) a customer adds to the profit of a firm. This project computes the CLTV given the absorbing state (number of periods after that a customer can't return, also called exit state), probabilities of return before the absorbing state,  and the discount rate.
